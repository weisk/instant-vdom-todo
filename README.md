# instant-vdom-todo
> Prehydrated, self-rewriting TodoMVC using Virtual-Dom and bottle-service

[![Build status][instant-vdom-todo-ci-image] ][instant-vdom-todo-ci-url]

[live demo](https://instant-todo.herokuapp.com/),
[screen recording of the demo](https://youtu.be/KRVoibtht84) - notice that
I reload the page multiple times, but the app appears instantly.

Uses [bottle-service](https://github.com/bahmutov/bottle-service) 
to enable HTML rewriting on page load.

Read the [Instant web application](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/instant-web-application/)
blog post.
